Summary: This is a JavaScript-based web app which allows the user to create simple pixel artwork and save it to their computer as a .png file.

During this project, I learned about: 
- JavaScript libraries: JQuery, FileSaver.js, HTML2Canvas
- Google material icons
- The quirks of color input elements
